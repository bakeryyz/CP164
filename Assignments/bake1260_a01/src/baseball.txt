The history of baseball can be broken down into various aspects: by era, by locale, by
organizational-type, game evolution, as well as by political and cultural influence. The game evolved
from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. 
This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th
century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States, and had begun to 
spread throughout the Pacific Rim and the Americas.Today, baseball is popular in North 
America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in 
Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.
